# IronOs-Flasher
A tool to flash ironos to the pinecil and ts irons 

# Current State
This will allow you to choose an iron and ironOs version and download it (current path is /tmp)

It wont flash them currently as i dont actually have my pinecil yet but it does almost everything else (other than language which ill get around to some time soon)

I also want to experiment with the async library in rust so the whole program doesnt freeze when downloading.

Also some sort of toast while stuff is downloading, flashing, etc.
