# PineFlash
A tool to flash ironos to the pinecil and in the future other pine products

# Dependancies
```
dfu-util
curl (you probably have this installed already)
```

# Current State
This will allow you to choose an iron and ironOs version and download it (current path is /tmp)

It should flash to the pinecil however mine hasnt actually arrived yet so there is a possibility i have gotten it wrong there. 

# Todo
Some sort of toast while stuff is downloading, flashing, etc.
